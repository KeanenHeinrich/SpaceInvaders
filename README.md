The classic game of Space Invaders, coded in Python and featuring painstakingly crafted works of art.
More specifically, the Pygame library was utilised to create the game, but more interestingly was my
first encounter with multi-threading in a practical context.

I have already been quite familiar with Python as of starting on this project, so I tried to find
interesting different ways to complicate it for myself in an attempt to get the most out of the experience.

This was probably the most enjoyable of my projects, in large part due to how direct the feedback of my modifications
and code adjustments were when testing it.
